# Local Organizing Committee

The **Local Organizing Committee** (LOC) is responsible for planning and executing all on-site aspects of the event. Its role includes coordinating logistics such as venues, accommodation, transportation, and technical infrastructure, as well as supporting the academic program. The LOC also ensures participants’ safety and well-being, manages volunteers, and represents the host country’s culture and hospitality, helping to create a smooth, fair, and memorable IOL experience for all participants.

# Jury

The academic nucleus of IOL is the **Problem Committee** (PC), a permanent body composed of researchers, teachers and former participants, all experienced solvers, testers and composers of the genre of self-sufficient linguistics problems. The PC works the whole year in the multilingual composition of the problems, in order to guarantee that all language versions of the problems are functionally equal. You can learn more about the PC [here](https://ioling.org/pc/).

During the event, the academic work (distributing the problems, overseeing the exams, marking the papers, presenting solutions, giving awards) is done by an **International Jury**, composed by members drawn from the PC.

*The list of Jury members for IOL 2026 will be displayed here once the Jury selection is finalized.*

# Volunteers

In addition to the permanent bodies and to the LOC, running the actual IOL involves a lot of hands-on activities, performed by a group of national and international volunteers – working especially in coordinating, escorting and concierge-ing the students, but also preparing activities, distributing materials and keeping the flow and the energy of daily-life at IOL.

*The list of volunteers for IOL 2026 will be shown here once the volunteer selection is finalized.*

# Participants

The participants consist of delegations of **Contestants**, **Team Leaders** and additional **Observers**, representing their Country or Territory. They take part in the competition, academic discussions and cultural activities, contributing to the international and collaborative spirit of the IOL.

*The list of participating Countries and Territories for IOL 2026 will be updated based on the registered delegations.*
