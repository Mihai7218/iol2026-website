# The International Linguistics Olympiad

The *International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL)* is an annual international competition that brings together secondary school students and experts from various fields of linguistics.  

The competition challenges participants to analyze the grammar, structure, culture, and history of different languages and to demonstrate their linguistic abilities through puzzles and problem-solving challenges.

For more information about the olympiad, as well as past problems and results, please consult the official IOL [page](https://ioling.org).

# The host country: Romania

As the 23<sup>rd</sup> IOL is right around the corner, we welcome you to Romania! Get ready to explore a country where dramatic landscapes, centuries-old legends, and rich traditions come together in a captivating story.

## A Landscape Out of a Fairytale

Romania is a country of striking natural diversity, where landscapes shift dramatically from one region to another. Dense forests, rolling hills, fertile plains, and winding rivers create a patchwork of scenery that feels almost storybook-like. From traditional villages tucked into the countryside to the vast wetlands of the Danube Delta, this variety gives Romania a timeless, almost untouched charm.

At the heart of it all rise the *Carpathian Mountains*, Romania’s “backbone”, a wild, jagged range perfect for epic hikes and spotting the occasional brown bear. In the valleys of Transylvania, you’ll find perfectly preserved *medieval towns* and *fortified churches* that look like they’ve been frozen in time since the 14th century. Cobblestone streets, colorful facades, and centuries-old towers blend seamlessly with the surrounding peaks, creating a landscape that feels lifted straight from a fairytale.

## Beyond the Fangs

Yes, Dracula is allegedly the most famous Romanian! While the legend of the Count, created by Irish author Bram Stoker, is our most famous export, it was loosely inspired by the real-life *Vlad the Impaler*, a 15th-century Wallachian ruler known for his brutal methods of defending his land against invaders. Over time, history and fiction blurred, giving rise to one of the world’s most enduring myths.

The real magic, however, lies in Romania’s castles themselves. Whether it’s the spooky atmosphere of *Bran Castle*, often linked to Dracula, or the neo-Renaissance elegance of *Peleș Castle*, these walls whisper stories of power, intrigue, and mystery. Hidden passageways, dramatic legends, and unanswered questions invite visitors to look beyond the movies and uncover the secrets of the past.

## Threads of Tradition and Craft

Romanian culture is a refined blend of influences shaped by centuries spent at the crossroads of Roman, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Balkan worlds. This layered history has left its mark on language, customs, and everyday life, creating a cultural identity that feels both familiar and unique. Rather than existing only in museums, these traditions remain deeply rooted in rural communities, where craftsmanship is still practiced as a living art passed down through generations.

From the intricate *Horezu ceramics*, instantly recognizable by their hand-painted rooster motifs, to the monumental *wooden gates and churches of Maramureș*, Romanian craftsmanship balances beauty and meaning. The iconic Romanian blouse, *ia*, with its delicate hand-stitched patterns, is more than a garment; it is a visual language. Geometric shapes and natural symbols quietly tell ancient stories of protection, the sun, and the cycle of life, transforming everyday objects into carriers of memory and identity.

## A Taste of Home

Romanian cuisine reflects the country’s rich cultural heritage, shaped by geography, history, and regional diversity. At its heart are hearty, comforting dishes meant to bring people together. They are often prepared slowly and shared during family gatherings. Local ingredients, cabbage, cornmeal, dairy, and forest fruits, form the foundation of recipes that have endured for centuries.

Classics include *sarmale*, minced meat and rice wrapped in pickled cabbage leaves, and *papanași*, fried cheese-filled doughnuts topped with sour cream and forest fruit preserves. Simple yet indulgent, Romanian food is defined by authenticity, offering a true taste of home and history in every bite.
