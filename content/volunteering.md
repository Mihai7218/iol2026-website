If you are excited by the idea of joining an amazing team of volunteers in Bucharest and creating an incredible event for young students fascinated by linguistics, consider volunteering at IOL 2026!

{{ image_row(category="past-volunteers") }}

The Local Organizing Committee is looking for both Romanian and International volunteers who are passionate about event organization and eager to work in a multilingual, multicultural environment. You should be able to speak good English and have some knowledge of other languages! For international volunteers, we expect some knowledge of how IOL works as well!

**Note**: The work is done on a volunteer basis. Additionally:
- To be eligible as a volunteer you must be **at least 18 years old** at the start of the event.
- Volunteers are expected to **arrive to the event 2 days before** the scheduled start date.
- Food and lodging is covered for the volunteers during the event; however, each volunteer should **come to Bucharest by their own means**.
- Prior experience with the IOL is beneficial, but **not necessary**.
